# CoderDojo

In this repository you will find all the resources I developed and used during my time as a mentor at CoderDojo.

## What is CoderDojo?

CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs for young people. Anyone aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.

I was a mentor at CoderDojo in the city of Braga, Portugal. More information about CoderDojo Braga can be found [here](https://coderdojobraga.org/).

## Resources

Since i was a python mentor, most of the resources are related to Python programming language. You can find them in the `Material` folder.
The resources are divided into two categories: `FichasTeoria` and `ProjetosExemplo`.

### FichasTeoria

In this folder you will find some theory sheets that I created to help the ninjas understand some basic concepts of programming and some basic exercises to practice.

### ProjetosExemplo

In this folder you will find some example projects that I created to help the ninjas understand how to create a project from scratch. Be it a simple game using pygame or a terminal application.
